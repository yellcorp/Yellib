A general-purpose ActionScript 3 library that has accreted over the years.

As such, it is a menagerie of ideas at various levels of refinement.  Some
have thrived under the harshest of scrutiny and matured into lithe,
indispensable whips of code.  Others have languished in shadowy oubliettes,
conceived half-baked or worse, living short, mad lives, then banished by a
creator only just lucid enough to recognise them as embarrassing.

The project is separated into two broad groups - 'raw' having no dependencies
other than Flash Player itself, and 'air', which depends on Adobe AIR.
